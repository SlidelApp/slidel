## Development Instructions

### Install Dependencies

Dependency Management is done with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). After
installing poetry, to install dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

For further instructions on how to add and manage dependencies please refer to
the [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### Git Workflow

Please make a new branch, preferably off of `main`, for each feature you are
working on. When you are done with your feature, please open a pull request.

Please make sure resolve any merge conflicts and make sure linting and tests
pass before merging a pull request.

All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other person before being
merged into `main`.
